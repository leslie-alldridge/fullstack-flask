## Full Stack Python Flask Application

###Goals:
As Django is where I feel most comfortable in the Python world, I wanted to learn more about Flask and see how it compares.

I found that flask generally runs faster as it comes with less baggage, but certain functionality isn't pre-built so it takes a little longer to get up and running with a database and CRUD actions using an ORM.

###Build status:
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leslie-alldridge/fullstack-flask.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leslie-alldridge/fullstack-flask)

###Where to next:
Additional styling and functionality would be good to add but in the meantime I think my focus will remain on React + Django.

###URL to Heroku:

###Overall:
It was fun to learn something new and I will add this project to my featured repos to demonstrate my interest and current ability in Python.
